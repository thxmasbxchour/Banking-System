WWW: I learnt a lot about python and its multiple functions. In OOP, I learnt how to use classes, inheritence, polymorthism, construction, how to use multiple modules in python such as random, csv, panda and colorama as just
some of them. This project has taught me how to use git as well to a full extent and what I should do in the future for programming jobs. Classes are placeholders for methods which can control a program. Inheritence allows you 
to use other classes methods' in different classes. Construction is the placeholder of variables you can declare at the top of a class and not in a method.

EBI: I encountered a few errors with pandas and csv as this was the first time learning about them and found it quite difficult to get into and become fluent in it. At this point in time, I am still not fluent in it yet 
have a better understanding. I should have learnt about it more before even endulging in such an activity. 

What I can do next time: Next time, I can document the program more allowing users to understand what steps I took to write this program giving them a better understanding of it and any errors that they may come accross when 
using/testing this program. Next time, I will use version control which will allow users to see updated versions of the code and see the steps I took. Also, I would upload the classes and different classes in each file. This 
would start with the Register class and end with the change username/password class. Therefore, users who want to create a program like I have can have a brief understanding in the steps I took and how they can do it if they 
wanted to.
