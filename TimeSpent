In October I started creating the program.
  
I started making the register class. This took me a few weeks to complete as I was learning everything new.
  
After this, I made the login page. This again took me a few weeks to complete as I was learning about everything.

After this, I made the homepage with all the information showing up which took me around a month to complete and implement everything into the system.
  
Lastly, I decided to do the change information class which took me the longest by far and took me around 2 months to complete therefore finishing the program.

17/07/2023 - I fixed the change password mechanism and was happy with the code.

17/07/2023 - I added that after view details of card it goes back to the menu

I learned a lot from this project about OOP and really enjoyed making it.
